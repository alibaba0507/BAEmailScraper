Health benefits can include weight loss and lowering your risk for certain diseases.The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits.In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health (1).Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease (2, 3, 4, 5).Here is a detailed beginner’s guide to the keto diet.What is a ketogenic diet?Keto basicsThe ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain (6).Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits (6, 7, 8).SUMMARYThe keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones.Different types of ketogenic dietsThere are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including:Standard ketogenic diet (SKD): This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs (9).Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD): This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD): This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.High protein ketogenic diet: This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes.The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.SUMMARYThere are several versions of the keto diet. The standard (SKD) version is the most researched and most recommended.What is ketosis?Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs.It occurs when you significantly reduce your consumption of carbohydrates, limiting your body’s supply of glucose (sugar), which is the main source of energy for the cells.Following a ketogenic diet is the most effective way to enter ketosis. Generally, this involves limiting carb consumption to around 20 to 50 grams per day and filling up on fats, such as meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils (6).It’s also important to moderate your protein consumption. This is because protein can be converted into glucose if consumed in high amounts, which may slow your transition into ketosis (10).Practicing intermittent fasting could also help you enter ketosis faster. There are many different forms of intermittent fasting, but the most common method involves limiting food intake to around 8 hours per day and fasting for the remaining 16 hours (11).Blood, urine, and breath tests are available, which can help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis by measuring the amount of ketones produced by your body.Certain symptoms may also indicate that you’ve entered ketosis, including increased thirst, dry mouth, frequent urination, and decreased hunger or appetite (12).SUMMARYKetosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs. Modifying your diet and practicing intermittent fasting can help you enter ketosis faster. Certain tests and symptoms can also help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis.Ketogenic diets can help you lose weightA ketogenic diet is an effective way to lose weight and lower risk factors for disease (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).In fact, research shows that the ketogenic diet may be as effective for weight loss as a low fat diet (13, 14, 15).What’s more, the diet is so filling that you can lose weight without counting calories or tracking your food intake (16).One review of 13 studies found that following a very low carb, ketogenic diet was slightly more effective for long-term weight loss than a low fat diet. People who followed the keto diet lost an average of 2 pounds (0.9 kg) more than the group that followed a low fat diet (13).What’s more, it also led to reductions in diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels (13).Another study in 34 older adults found that those who followed a ketogenic diet for 8 weeks lost nearly five times as much total body fat as those who followed a low fat diet (17).The increased ketones, lower blood sugar levels, and improved insulin sensitivity may also play a key role (18, 19).For more details on the weight loss effects of a ketogenic diet, read this article.SUMMARYA ketogenic diet can help you lose slightly more weight than a low fat diet. This often happens with less hunger.Ketogenic diets for diabetes and prediabetesDiabetes is characterized by changes in metabolism, high blood sugar, and impaired insulin function (20).The ketogenic diet can help you lose excess fat, which is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome (21, 22, 23, 24).One older study found that the ketogenic diet improved insulin sensitivity by a whopping 75% (25).A small study in women with type 2 diabetes also found that following a ketogenic diet for 90 days significantly reduced levels of hemoglobin A1C, which is a measure of long-term blood sugar management (26).Another study in 349 people with type 2 diabetes found that those who followed a ketogenic diet lost an average of 26.2 pounds (11.9 kg) over a 2-year period. This is an important benefit when considering the link between weight and type 2 diabetes (24, 27).What’s more, they also experienced improved blood sugar management, and the use of certain blood sugar medications decreased among participants throughout the course of the study (27).For more information, check out this article on the benefits of low carb diets for people with diabetes.SUMMARYThe ketogenic diet can boost insulin sensitivity and cause fat loss, leading to significant health benefits for people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.Other health benefits of ketoThe ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for treating neurological diseases such as epilepsy.Studies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions:Heart disease. The ketogenic diet can help improve risk factors like body fat, HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar (28, 29).Cancer. The diet is currently being explored as an additional treatment for cancer, because it may help slow tumor growth. (4, 30, 31).Alzheimer’s disease. The keto diet may help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and slow its progression (5, 32, 33).Epilepsy. Research has shown that the ketogenic diet can cause significant reductions in seizures in epileptic children (3).Parkinson’s disease. Although more research is needed, one study found that the diet helped improve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (34).Polycystic ovary syndrome. The ketogenic diet can help reduce insulin levels, which may play a key role in polycystic ovary syndrome (35, 36).Brain injuries. Some research suggests that the diet could improve outcomes of traumatic brain injuries (37).However, keep in mind that research into many of these areas is far from conclusive.SUMMARYA ketogenic diet may provide many health benefits, especially with metabolic, neurological, or insulin-related diseases. Foods to avoidAny food that’s high in carbs should be limited.Here’s a list of foods that need to be reduced or eliminated on a ketogenic diet:sugary foods: soda, fruit juice, smoothies, cake, ice cream, candy, etc.grains or starches: wheat-based products, rice, pasta, cereal, etc.fruit: all fruit, except small portions of berries like strawberriesbeans or legumes: peas, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, etc.root vegetables and tubers: potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, etc.low fat or diet products: low fat mayonnaise, salad dressings, and condimentssome condiments or sauces: barbecue sauce, honey mustard, teriyaki sauce, ketchup, etc.unhealthy fats: processed vegetable oils, mayonnaise, etc.alcohol: beer, wine, liquor, mixed drinkssugar-free diet foods: sugar-free candies, syrups, puddings, sweeteners, desserts, etc.SUMMARYAvoid carb-based foods like grains, sugars, legumes, rice, potatoes, candy, juice, and even most fruits.Foods to eatYou should base the majority of your meals around these foods:meat: red meat, steak, ham, sausage, bacon, chicken, and turkeyfatty fish: salmon, trout, tuna, and mackereleggs: pastured or omega-3 whole eggsbutter and cream: grass-fed butter and heavy creamcheese: unprocessed cheeses like cheddar, goat, cream, blue, or mozzarellanuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, etc.healthy oils: extra virgin olive oil, and avocado oilavocados: whole avocados or freshly made guacamolelow carb veggies: green veggies, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc.condiments: salt, pepper, herbs, and spicesIt’s best to base your diet mostly on whole, single-ingredient foods.

Order this and replace any high carb food with extra vegetables.Egg-based meals are also a great option, such as an omelet or eggs and bacon.Another favorite is bun-less burgers. You could also swap the fries for vegetables instead. Add extra avocado, cheese, bacon, or eggs.At Mexican restaurants, you can enjoy any type of meat with extra cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.For dessert, ask for a mixed cheese board or berries with cream.SUMMARYWhen eating out, select a meat-, fish-, or egg-based dish. Order extra veggies instead of carbs or starches, and have cheese for dessert.Side effects and how to minimize themAlthough the ketogenic diet is usually safe for most healthy people, there may be some initial side effects while your body adapts.There’s some anecdotal evidence of these effects often referred to as the keto flu (38). Based on reports from some on the eating plan, it’s usually over within a few days.Reported keto flu symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting (39). Other less common symptoms include:poor energy and mental function increased hunger sleep issues nauseadigestive discomfort decreased exercise performanceTo minimize this, you can try a regular low carb diet for the first few weeks. This may teach your body to burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbs.A ketogenic diet can also change the water and mineral balance of your body, so adding extra salt to your meals or taking mineral supplements may help. Talk to your doctor about your nutritional needs.At least in the beginning, it’s important to eat until you’re full and avoid restricting calories too much. Usually, a ketogenic diet causes weight loss without intentional calorie restriction.SUMMARYMany of the side effects of starting a ketogenic diet can be limited. Easing into the diet and taking mineral supplements can help.Risks of the keto dietStaying on the keto diet in the long term may have some negative effects, including risks of the following: low protein in the bloodextra fat in the liverkidney stonesmicronutrient deficienciesA type of medication called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes can increase the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous condition that increases blood acidity. Anyone taking this medication should avoid the keto diet (40, 41).More research is being done to determine the safety of the keto diet in the long term. Keep your doctor informed of your eating plan to guide your choices.SUMMARYThere are some side effects to the keto diet about which you should speak to your doctor if you plan to stay on the diet long term.Supplements for a ketogenic dietAlthough no supplements are required, some can be useful.MCT oil. Added to drinks or yogurt, MCT oil provides energy and helps increase ketone levels. Shop for MCT oil online (42, 43).Minerals. Added salt and other minerals can be important when starting out due to shifts in water and mineral balance (44).Caffeine. Caffeine can have benefits for energy, fat loss, and performance (45).Exogenous ketones. This supplement may help raise the body’s ketone levels (46).Creatine. Creatine provides numerous benefits for health and performance. This can help if you are combining a ketogenic diet with exercise (47).Whey. Use half a scoop of whey protein in shakes or yogurt to increase your daily protein intake (48, 49). Shop for tasty whey products on online.SUMMARYCertain supplements can be beneficial on a ketogenic diet. These include exogenous ketones, MCT oil, and minerals.Frequently asked questionsHere are answers to some of the most common questions about the ketogenic diet.1. Can I ever eat carbs again?Yes. However, it’s important to significantly reduce your carb intake initially. After the first 2 to 3 months, you can eat carbs on special occasions — just return to the diet immediately after.2. Will I lose muscle?There’s a risk of losing some muscle on any diet. However, protein intake and high ketone levels may help minimize muscle loss, especially if you lift weights (50, 51).3. Can I build muscle on a ketogenic diet?Yes, but it may not work as well as on a moderate carb diet (52, 53). For more details about low carb or keto diets and exercise performance, read this article.4. How much protein can I eat?Protein should be moderate, as a very high intake can spike insulin levels and lower ketones. Around 35% of total calorie intake is probably the upper limit.5. What if I am constantly tired, weak, or fatigued?You may not be in full ketosis or be utilizing fats and ketones efficiently. To counter this, lower your carb intake and revisit the points above. A supplement like MCT oil or ketones may also help (42, 43).6. My urine smells fruity. Why is this?Don’t be alarmed. This is simply due to the excretion of by-products created during ketosis (54).7. My breath smells. What can I do?This is a common side effect. Try drinking naturally flavored water or chewing sugar-free gum.8. I heard ketosis was extremely dangerous. Is this true?People often confuse ketosis with ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is dangerous, but the ketosis on a ketogenic diet is usually fine for healthy people. Speak to your doctor before starting any new diet.9. I have digestion issues and diarrhea. What can I do?This common side effect usually passes after 3 to 4 weeks. If it persists, try eating more high fiber veggies (55, 56). The bottom lineA ketogenic diet can be great for people who:are overweight have diabetes are looking to improve their metabolic healthIt may be less suitable for elite athletes or those wishing to add large amounts of muscle or weight.It may also not be sustainable for some people’s lifestyles and preferences.

      Burning fat by eating fat, sounds too good to be true, right? Wrong. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, chances are you've heard of the ketogenic diet.
The keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that consists of about 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% net carbs. Research has shown that this low-carb diet not only promotes fat loss but has the ability to improve certain conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cognitive decline[*][*].

WHAT IS A KETOGENIC DIET?
The ketogenic diet, also known as the keto diet, is the idea of transitioning your body from burning fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.
So, how does the keto diet work? Let’s break it down, here is the keto diet explained. The body produces two substances when carbohydrate intake is high:


Glucose: Glucose is the easiest molecule for the body to convert to energy. This is the reason that carbohydrate intake will negate the ability of the body to enter ketosis. If carbohydrate intake is high, the body defaults to using glucose for energy.


Insulin: Insulin aids in the transport of glucose around the body. When you reduce your carb intake and replace it with fat, it puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.


Ketosis is defined as the process by which your body breaks down fatty acids to produce ketones in the liver, which can supply both the brain and body with energy[*]. Ketones come in three forms[*]:

Acetoacetate (AcAc)
Beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB)
Acetone

Simply put: carbs must be avoided if you want to stay in ketosis. Generally, you want to stay under 25 grams of net carbs (total carbs minus fiber) per day.
You also want to watch your protein intake. Protein is not the enemy, as with carbs. You want protein to make up a significant part of your diet. Protein provides plenty of essential functions that are still valuable to your body’s function in ketosis. However, keep this macronutrient to only a quarter of your diet.
In ketosis, fat is king. The rest of your calories should come from fat. Your body will be breaking down fat for energy in the absence of carbs.
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF KETOGENIC DIETS
When it comes to the keto diet, there are several types, allowing you to choose what is best for your lifestyle: 
Standard Ketogenic Diet (SKD)
The SKD is the standard diet an individual new to the keto diet would follow if they were first starting out. This diet follows the general guidelines of keto including low-carb, moderate protein and high-fat intake.
Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)
The CKD is more suited for athletes and active individuals alike who simply need the carbs to fuel their intense training sessions. This diet involves a period of higher-carb refeeds during the week. An example would be 5 days of following the SKD and then 2 days of high-carbs (anywhere from 400-600 grams).
Targeted Ketogenic Diet (TKD)
The TKD is also meant for more active individuals who struggle with energy during their workouts, but it's less intense compared to the CKD. The TKD follows the SKD for the most part, but with an additional 25-50 grams of net carbs around your workout times (about 30 minutes pre and post-workout).
High-Protein Ketogenic Diet
This type of ketogenic diet isn't too far off from the Standard Ketogenic Diet, however, it does include more protein. Compared to the 25% of protein included in the SKD, the high-protein ketogenic diet often includes up to 35%.
HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE KETOGENIC DIET
When it comes to the health benefits you can gain from the ketogenic diet, the list goes on and on in both the short term and the long term. It can not only help you lose weight, but studiesshow that the keto diet is superior to the often recommended low-fat diet for weight loss[*]. Some top health benefits include:
1. Improves Weight Loss
Overweight and obese individuals have had tremendous success with weight loss following the keto diet. One study, in particular, found that people on a keto diet lose 2.2 times the amount of weight than those on a calorie-restricted low-fat diet. The keto diet is also known to turn your body into a fat-burning machine. What does this lead to? Weight loss.
2. Reduces Inflammation
While inflammation is a natural biological response, chronic inflammation is a bad thing. A keto diet can help reduce inflammation in the body by switching off a number of different inflammatory pathways[*].
3. Increases Energy Levels
When you switch to a keto diet, your brain switches to ketones as fuel instead of carbs. Running off of ketones, you experience fewer energy slumps as you do when compared to eating a lot of carbs. Ketosis helps clear the brain of brain fog while creating more mitochondria (cells that help generate energy and power)[*].
So we've discussed what the keto diet is along with some health benefits. But what can you eat on a keto diet, anyway?
FOODS TO EAT ON A KETO DIET
When it comes to deciding what to eat on the keto diet, the rules are pretty simple. Eat mostly healthy fats (about 75% of your daily calories should come from fats), moderate protein intake (about 20%) and minimal carbs (no more than 5%). Choose lower carb foods such as grass-fed meat, wild-caught fish, eggs, leafy vegetables, and high-quality fats. Some of these foods include:


Fats: Avocado oil, cacao butter, coconut butter, cod liver oil, grass-fed butter, grass-fed ghee, MCT oil, bacon fat, egg yolk, lard, marrow and tallow, sunflower lecithin, coconut oil.


Protein: Dark meats, sugar-free jerky, eggs, fish, gelatin, organ meats, pork, shellfish, chicken, turkey, wild-caught fish, and whey protein concentrate.


Vegetables: Asparagus, avocado, butter greens, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, chard, collards, cucumbers, kale, kohlrabi, lettuce, radish, spinach, summer squash, zucchini.


Dairy: Grass-fed butter, grass-fed ghee, cheese (depending on the type).


Beverages: Water, water with lemon, coffee, variety of different teas, carbonated water, non-dairy milk, bone broth, certain kombucha, coconut water, certain smoothies.


FOODS TO AVOID ON THE KETO DIET
Avoiding certain foods might be tricky when first starting the ketogenic diet, but not impossible. Make sure you pay attention to the number of carbs you're eating as you could easily throw off your progress and get kicked out of a ketogenic state. Some foods you should avoid on keto include:


Grains: Wheat, barley, oats, rice, quinoa, sorghum. All of it. You do not want grains.


Beans: Kidney beans, black beans, chickpeas, lentils, pinto beans, black-eyed peas.


Fruits: Believe it or not, fruit is on the list. This includes high-carb fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, papaya, mangoes, and grapes.


Starchy vegetables: Corn, carrots, parsnips, peas, and yams.


Sugars: Maple syrup, cane sugar, agave, and honey.


Beverages: Soda, juices, sports drinks, high-sugar coffee drinks, beer, and other high-sugar alcoholic drinks.


Now that you know the dos and don'ts of what to eat on the ketogenic diet, what does a keto meal plan look like?

TIPS FOR EATING OUT ON THE KETO DIET
A real benefit to the keto diet is that on-the-go snacks, and fast-food restaurants offer options that work within its restrictions. This can be a real benefit for people like retail employees who order out or run next door on their short and unpredictable lunch breaks. It works for people who travel a lot and spend time in airports, away from easy ways to prepare their meals.
Here are some tips for eating out on the keto diet:

Ordering a cheeseburger on a lettuce bun.
If you're visiting a Chipotle or somewhere similar, you can easily order a salad with no beans or rice and top it off with steak and guacamole.
Go the carnivore route and get a steak with a side of green veggies instead of potatoes or other starchy vegetables.
If you're stopping for a quick snack at the local gas station, grab some jerky or a bag of nuts for your journey instead.

Did someone say yum?
HELPFUL TIPS TO GET STARTED ON THE KETO DIET
Starting any kind of diet can be tough, but especially the ketogenic diet. Keto for beginners is not only about changing your diet, but it's about changing your lifestyle. However, it doesn't have to be a challenge.
Here are several helpful tips to help you follow a ketogenic diet without any stress:


Increase your awareness and education. Learning how to read food labels is key in sticking within keto diet rules. Practice examining food labels and macronutrients to recognize carb count, net carbs, and fiber count so you can be sure you'll remain in a ketogenic state.


Share your health goals with friends and family. If your friends and loved ones closest to you know that you're trying to start a new diet and lifestyle (and that it means a lot to you), they're more likely to be supportive and choose places with your goals in mind. If you're going out for Mexican food, you may be a bit too tempted to eat those chips. Choose spots that will allow you to relax a bit and have fun without the stress of food.


Buy a keto cookbook. Getting a keto cookbook or finding recipes from a number of different websites and resources online is a great way to improve your creativity with your cooking and meals. Most people worry about being too restricted when it comes to the keto diet, but there's always a way to make it fun.


Plan ahead. If you're traveling, be sure to plan ahead. Make sure you research places to eat and snack. Otherwise, stick to what you know when it comes to the keto diet: healthy fats, minimum carbs, and moderate protein intake with no artificial or processed ingredients.


Bring your own food. If you're visiting family or going to a gathering, take keto-friendly snacks you know you can eat. This way you won’t feel left out of group meals and you don’t have to worry about feeling too picky.


THE BOTTOM LINE
While the ketogenic diet may be intimidating at first, there’s no cause for alarm. The ketogenic diet can help you safely lose weight while improving your overall health without stress. As with any diet, the ketogenic diet will only work if you remain consistent and disciplined.
And while the ketogenic diet is great for some individuals, it’s important to remember it’s not for everyone. It may be less suitable for elite athletes or very active individuals looking to improve muscle mass or high-intensity training.

When it comes to the keto diet, there are several types, allowing you to choose what is best for your lifestyle: 
Standard Ketogenic Diet (SKD)
The SKD is the standard diet an individual new to the keto diet would follow if they were first starting out. This diet follows the general guidelines of keto including low-carb, moderate protein and high-fat intake.
Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)
The CKD is more suited for athletes and active individuals alike who simply need the carbs to fuel their intense training sessions. This diet involves a period of higher-carb refeeds during the week. An example would be 5 days of following the SKD and then 2 days of high-carbs (anywhere from 400-600 grams).
Targeted Ketogenic Diet (TKD)
The TKD is also meant for more active individuals who struggle with energy during their workouts, but it's less intense compared to the CKD. The TKD follows the SKD for the most part, but with an additional 25-50 grams of net carbs around your workout times (about 30 minutes pre and post-workout).
High-Protein Ketogenic Diet
This type of ketogenic diet isn't too far off from the Standard Ketogenic Diet, however, it does include more protein. Compared to the 25% of protein included in the SKD, the high-protein ketogenic diet often includes up to 35%.
HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE KETOGENIC DIET
When it comes to the health benefits you can gain from the ketogenic diet, the list goes on and on in both the short term and the long term. It can not only help you lose weight, but studiesshow that the keto diet is superior to the often recommended low-fat diet for weight loss[*]. Some top health benefits include:
1. Improves Weight Loss
Overweight and obese individuals have had tremendous success with weight loss following the keto diet. One study, in particular, found that people on a keto diet lose 2.2 times the amount of weight than those on a calorie-restricted low-fat diet. The keto diet is also known to turn your body into a fat-burning machine. What does this lead to? Weight loss.
2. Reduces Inflammation
While inflammation is a natural biological response, chronic inflammation is a bad thing. A keto diet can help reduce inflammation in the body by switching off a number of different inflammatory pathways[*].
3. Increases Energy Levels
When you switch to a keto diet, your brain switches to ketones as fuel instead of carbs. Running off of ketones, you experience fewer energy slumps as you do when compared to eating a lot of carbs. Ketosis helps clear the brain of brain fog while creating more mitochondria (cells that help generate energy and power)[*].
So we've discussed what the keto diet is along with some health benefits. But what can you eat on a keto diet, anyway?
FOODS TO EAT ON A KETO DIET
When it comes to deciding what to eat on the keto diet, the rules are pretty simple. Eat mostly healthy fats (about 75% of your daily calories should come from fats), moderate protein intake (about 20%) and minimal carbs (no more than 5%). Choose lower carb foods such as grass-fed meat, wild-caught fish, eggs, leafy vegetables, and high-quality fats. Some of these foods include:


Fats: Avocado oil, cacao butter, coconut butter, cod liver oil, grass-fed butter, grass-fed ghee, MCT oil, bacon fat, egg yolk, lard, marrow and tallow, sunflower lecithin, coconut oil.


Protein: Dark meats, sugar-free jerky, eggs, fish, gelatin, organ meats, pork, shellfish, chicken, turkey, wild-caught fish, and whey protein concentrate.


Vegetables: Asparagus, avocado, butter greens, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, chard, collards, cucumbers, kale, kohlrabi, lettuce, radish, spinach, summer squash, zucchini.


Dairy: Grass-fed butter, grass-fed ghee, cheese (depending on the type).


Beverages: Water, water with lemon, coffee, variety of different teas, carbonated water, non-dairy milk, bone broth, certain kombucha, coconut water, certain smoothies.


FOODS TO AVOID ON THE KETO DIET
Avoiding certain foods might be tricky when first starting the ketogenic diet, but not impossible. Make sure you pay attention to the number of carbs you're eating as you could easily throw off your progress and get kicked out of a ketogenic state. Some foods you should avoid on keto include:


Grains: Wheat, barley, oats, rice, quinoa, sorghum. All of it. You do not want grains.


Beans: Kidney beans, black beans, chickpeas, lentils, pinto beans, black-eyed peas.


Fruits: Believe it or not, fruit is on the list. This includes high-carb fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, papaya, mangoes, and grapes.


Starchy vegetables: Corn, carrots, parsnips, peas, and yams.


Sugars: Maple syrup, cane sugar, agave, and honey.

TIPS FOR EATING OUT ON THE KETO DIET
A real benefit to the keto diet is that on-the-go snacks, and fast-food restaurants offer options that work within its restrictions. This can be a real benefit for people like retail employees who order out or run next door on their short and unpredictable lunch breaks. It works for people who travel a lot and spend time in airports, away from easy ways to prepare their meals.
Here are some tips for eating out on the keto diet:

Ordering a cheeseburger on a lettuce bun.
If you're visiting a Chipotle or somewhere similar, you can easily order a salad with no beans or rice and top it off with steak and guacamole.
Go the carnivore route and get a steak with a side of green veggies instead of potatoes or other starchy vegetables.
If you're stopping for a quick snack at the local gas station, grab some jerky or a bag of nuts for your journey instead.

HELPFUL TIPS TO GET STARTED ON THE KETO DIET
Starting any kind of diet can be tough, but especially the ketogenic diet. Keto for beginners is not only about changing your diet, but it's about changing your lifestyle. However, it doesn't have to be a challenge.
Here are several helpful tips to help you follow a ketogenic diet without any stress:


Increase your awareness and education. Learning how to read food labels is key in sticking within keto diet rules. Practice examining food labels and macronutrients to recognize carb count, net carbs, and fiber count so you can be sure you'll remain in a ketogenic state.


Share your health goals with friends and family. If your friends and loved ones closest to you know that you're trying to start a new diet and lifestyle (and that it means a lot to you), they're more likely to be supportive and choose places with your goals in mind. If you're going out for Mexican food, you may be a bit too tempted to eat those chips. Choose spots that will allow you to relax a bit and have fun without the stress of food.


Buy a keto cookbook. Getting a keto cookbook or finding recipes from a number of different websites and resources online is a great way to improve your creativity with your cooking and meals. Most people worry about being too restricted when it comes to the keto diet, but there's always a way to make it fun.


Plan ahead. If you're traveling, be sure to plan ahead. Make sure you research places to eat and snack. Otherwise, stick to what you know when it comes to the keto diet: healthy fats, minimum carbs, and moderate protein intake with no artificial or processed ingredients.


Bring your own food. If you're visiting family or going to a gathering, take keto-friendly snacks you know you can eat. This way you won’t feel left out of group meals and you don’t have to worry about feeling too picky.


THE BOTTOM LINE
While the ketogenic diet may be intimidating at first, there’s no cause for alarm. The ketogenic diet can help you safely lose weight while improving your overall health without stress. As with any diet, the ketogenic diet will only work if you remain consistent and disciplined.
And while the ketogenic diet is great for some individuals, it’s important to remember it’s not for everyone. It may be less suitable for elite athletes or very active individuals looking to improve muscle mass or high-intensity training.
