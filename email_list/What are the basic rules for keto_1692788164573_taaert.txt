A ketogenic diet is a high fat and low carb diet. Reducing carbs may put your body in ketosis, which causes it to use fat for energy. This may help with weight loss.If you find yourself in a conversation about dieting or weight loss, chances are you’ll hear about the ketogenic, or keto, diet. The keto diet has become one of the most popular methods worldwide among people trying to lose weight and improve their health. If you’ve been thinking about trying the keto diet and have gotten the thumbs up from your doctor, use this article to learn more about what to eat and what to limit while following a keto diet. Ketogenic diet basicsThe keto diet, as a rule, is very low in carbs, high in fat, and moderate in protein. While you can eat some carbs, you’ll need to monitor your intake.While different versions of the keto diet exist the percentage of calories a person will consume will be approximately as follows:carbs: 5–10%fats: 55–60%protein: 30–35%This carb reduction forces your body to rely on fats for its main energy source instead of glucose — a process known as ketosis.While in ketosis, your body uses ketones — molecules produced in the liver from fats when glucose is limited — as an alternate fuel source. Plus, keto diets reduce hunger and increase satiety, which can be helpful when trying to lose weight.Research shows that ketogenic diets are effective at promoting weight loss — though they may be no more effective than other weight-loss diets.SummaryThe ketogenic diet relies on a very low carb routine. Carbs are typically restricted to 20–50 grams per day on a 2,000-calorie diet. Instead, you’d eat mostly fat and protein. Ketogenic diet meal planSwitching to a ketogenic diet may seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. Your focus should be on reducing carbs while increasing the fat and protein content of meals and snacks. Some online tools and calculators can be helpful.In order to reach and remain in a state of ketosis, carbs must be restricted. While certain people might only achieve ketosis by eating 20 grams of carbs per day, others may be successful with a higher carb intake. Generally, the lower your carbohydrate intake, the easier it is to reach and stay in ketosis.This is why sticking to keto-friendly foods and avoiding items rich in carbs is the best way to successfully lose weight on a ketogenic diet.Keto-friendly foods When following a ketogenic diet, meals and snacks should center around the following foods:Eggs: pastured, organic, or conventional all work finePoultry: chicken and turkeyFatty fish: salmon, herring, and mackerelMeat: beef, venison, pork, organ meats, and bisonFull-fat dairy: unsweetened yogurt, butter, and cream, but check the labels as dairy does contain some carbsFull-fat cheese: cheddar, mozzarella, brie, goat cheese, and cream cheeseNuts and seeds: macadamia nuts, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, and flaxseedsNut butter: no-sugar-added peanut, almond, and cashew buttersOils rich in healthy fats: olive oil, avocado oil, and sesame oilAvocados: whole avocados can be added to almost any meal or snackNon-starchy vegetables: greens, broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppersCondiments: salt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, fresh herbs, and spicesFoods to limitWhen possible, it’s best to avoid or limit foods rich in carbs while following a keto diet.

The keto diet may also have neuroprotective effects and help improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer’s disease, though more research is needed.Drawbacks and risksWhile the keto diet does seem to have some benefits, it is unlikely to be suitable in the long term. And, while it may help you lose weight, stopping can lead to weight regain. Also, the keto diet is not recommended for everyone. A keto diet is typically high in saturated fat and trans fats. These can raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in some individuals, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.It can also be low in vegetables, grains, and legumes, meaning you may not get enough fiber and B vitamins to maintain essential body functions.The diet is very restrictive and needs careful planning, which makes it hard to sustain. The lack of diversity can lead not only to nutritional deficiencies but also boredom. It can affect social events, as eating out becomes more difficult.Finally, it may not be safe for those who are pregnant or nursing, or those who have kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or type 1 diabetes.For these reasons, it’s best to check with a health professional before trying a keto diet.SummaryA ketogenic diet may help manage weight and glucose levels, among other benefits. However, it also involves a high fat intake, and may not be suitable for everyone.{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What do you eat on a keto diet?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Depending on the precise keto diet you choose, carbs will make up 5–10%, fats 50–55%, and protein 30–35%.
